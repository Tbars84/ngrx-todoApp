Here’s a nicely formatted version of the README content for the `todos` module:

---

# Todos Module

The `todos` module provides a comprehensive functionality for managing a task list, including:

- Adding new tasks.
- Marking tasks as completed or pending.
- Deleting tasks.
- Filtering tasks by status: all, completed, or pending.

---

## Folder Structure

The module is organized as follows:

```
src/app/todos/
├── components/
│   ├── todo-add/        # UI component for adding tasks
│   ├── todo-footer/     # UI component for task filters
│   ├── todo-item/       # UI component for individual task items
│   └── todo-list/       # UI component for displaying the task list
├── state/
│   ├── actions/         # Defines NgRx actions for state management
│   ├── effects/         # Handles side effects for state changes
│   ├── reducers/        # Contains reducers for managing the state tree
│   └── selectors/       # Selectors for querying state
├── todo.module.ts       # Defines the `TodosModule`, declares & exports components, imports necessary modules
```

## Overview of Folders

### `components/`
This folder contains all the User Interface components:
- **`todo-add/`**: A component for adding new tasks.
- **`todo-footer/`**: A component for displaying and managing task filters.
- **`todo-item/`**: A component representing individual task items.
- **`todo-list/`**: A component for rendering the complete list of tasks.

### `state/`
This folder includes the logic for state management using NgRx:
- **`actions/`**: Defines the actions to trigger state changes.
- **`effects/`**: Handles side effects (e.g., asynchronous operations).
- **`reducers/`**: Defines how the state is updated in response to actions.
- **`selectors/`**: Provides functions to query the state.

### `todo.module.ts`
This file defines the `TodosModule`, which:
- Declares and exports the components.
- Imports all the necessary Angular and NgRx modules.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Add, mark, delete, and filter tasks.
- **State Management**: Utilizes NgRx for predictable state handling.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into reusable components and state management logic.
